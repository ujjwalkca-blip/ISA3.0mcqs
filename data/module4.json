      "options": [
        "High cost of documentation.",
        "Inability to accommodate major requirement changes in later stages without significant cost and schedule delays.",

        "Low user involvement in the initial requirements phase."
      ],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "The rigid, sequential structure of the Waterfall model means that requirements are fixed early on. Any substantial requirement changes discovered during testing or implementation necessitate costly backtracking and re-engineering of all previous phases."

      ],
      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Prototyping focuses on user feedback and speed. The risk is that the initial, often unstable, code base (the prototype) becomes the foundation of the final production system without undergoing proper architectural design, control integration, and documentation."

      "answerIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Segregation of Duties (SoD) requires separating conflicting roles. The person developing the code (programmer) should be separate from the person who authorizes and implements the code into production (librarian/change manager) to prevent unauthorized changes."
