      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Application level gateway firewalls are also called proxies and are similar to circuit-level gateways. However, they are application-specific & monitor the contents of applications before allowing traffic. However, any break-in will only compromise the firewall and not the entire network in the case of Application Level Gateway firewalls. They can provide auditing and logging functions. They are more secure than Packet Filters and Stateful Inspection Firewalls. Hence, answer in Option A is correct. The answers in the other options are incorrect."

It is useful for implementation of VPN as also for remote user access through dial-up connection. It has as its basic goals authenticity and data integrity. It can operate in two modes transport & tunnel. In tunnel mode, used for VPN, the entire IP packet is encrypted and a new header added to the packet for transmission. Hence, the answer in Option A only is correct."

Based upon this, relevant best practices & benchmark indices can be identified & incorporated in the final model in order to extract maximum benefit from the software. Legacy systems elimination can be undertaken only after successful commissioning of the ERP (at least at the pilot level). While it may seem attractive to accelerate the implementation with the objective of generating savings earlier, it would be far better to ensure that the approved model is robust & flexible enough to accommodate potential changes in the environment. Lastly, an ERP is ideally implemented enterprise-wide in order to harness the power of the software. Implementing it in part of the organization would leave it in a stunted & sub-optimal form.

It would not be a prudent choice for a disaster recovery facility since, as a proximate location, the probability of its getting exposed to the same geographical risks is very high. Use of hard copies of documents would be a retrograde step which would only delay processes & add costs. While cloud storage could be a solution, it could raise issues of data security.

A retail grocery chain store analyses data of its sales over different time periods over the day. It observes that in many of its markets, substantial sales happen throughout the day but in certain specific markets, sales peaked late in the evening. In these markets, frequent instances were also reported of staff having to send away customers as late as 10 pm in the night since closing time for the store had been crossed. On carrying out a more detailed analysis of the profile of the customers in these markets, it discovered that these were dominated by young employees of IT & BPO companies, many of whom worked in line with U.S. and European markets & returned home late in the night."

      "explanation": "One weakness of XML is that it lacks inherent security, any means of validation, confidentiality or integrity. However, its main strength is its ability to create data in a format which can be read by different applications & can handle data even when it is not in compatible format. It is supported by major software products & is in easily readable format. XML is, in fact, more powerful than HTML since it facilitates automatic manipulation & interpretation of data. Hence, Option D is correct."

It reduces the risk of fraud since one person cannot independently commit any fraud but would need to collude with the second. Also, since the output of one individual may become the input of another, an independent accuracy check of one person s work by another person becomes a built-in reality.

You question him about the purpose of the visit and learn that the executive just wanted to have a tour of the facility, as part of his induction. Do you agree or disagree with the executive ? Why ?",

          "text": "No, I would not agree. Physical access control to the server is an important control mechanism"
        }
      ],
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Physical access control to the server room is an important part of IT General controls in any organization. The server is a sensitive equipment with certain commands & settings being exclusive to it. Un-authorized access to it could compromise the security of the IT system & the organization, obviously, has a clearly defined access policy which has to be respected. Relationship to the promoter cannot be an excuse for breaking the policy; if, indeed, he had genuine need to visit the server room, he could have got the necessary clearances. Denial of access cannot be owing to the newness of the employee. Lastly, any robust system operates at different levels of redundancy & the mere existence of password protected access to the server does not prevent a second level of defence, in the form of access control, being done away with. Hence, the answer in Option D is correct."

In any professional organization, no positive bias can be allowed for the dominance of so-called family retainers however trustworthy they may be.

The industry norm is that mobile phone manufacturers invariably offer customers the comfort of prompt and efficient after sales service, including repair. After a lot of introspection, the company decides that the probability of failure of their product was so low and it would not be worth their while to invest in a network of servicing facilities. They decided, instead to offer a free replacement in the event of failure of their product. In fact, they decided to leverage this itself as a marketing strategy for their product and it turned out to be a roaring success.

Farmers use agro chemicals, typically, only when they perceive a pest attack and would like to act immediately then to save their crop.

You suggest that the client should go through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process for best results. Your client is happy with your suggestion but requests that not all aspects of the selection process be publicised up-front. For, the client had faced situations in the past wherein, openness in such matters had lead to issues of disputes with suppliers who were rejected in the selection process. The client s argument is that, in any case, the selection will be on a fair and equitable basis & the idea is just to avoid giving too much information to the bidders and create the potential for nuisance attacks by mischievous, unsuccessful bidders. As a Chartered Accountant, would your suggestion be to clearly spell out the selection criteria or leave it ambiguous ?",

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "It would be best to clearly spell out all the selection criteria. For, it would give confidence to the potential bidders about the credibility of the buyer and also avoid build up of un-necessary cushions to take care of any unknown contingencies. Also, ambiguities cut both ways & may provide loopholes for unscrupulous bidders to wriggle out of commitments or raise disputes. Contractually & legally speaking, too, such a RFP will strengthen the organization s hands in the event of any default or failure on the part of the chosen supplier.

      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "It is clear that the auditing team is a competent one with sound knowledge of I.T. It is unlikely that the auditee team deliberately sought to scuttle the auditing team s report. For, given the fact that they have the top management s approval, the I.T. department cannot hope to gain anything by throwing mud on the auditing team. If the auditee still questions the validity of the team s report, the single major cause which can be inferred from the question stem is that the communication to the auditee has not been carried out in an effective manner & adequate steps have not been taken to secure auditee buy-in for the process . Hence, answer at Option D appears to be more appropriate."

      "explanation": "Given the fact that any audit team would have limitations in terms of auditing resources as well as budget, it would have to get maximum mileage for the auditee with the limited resources at its disposal. Hence, rather than spreading itself too thin by trying to audit as many areas as possible, the ideal strategy would be to arrive at a consensus regarding a few areas of high risk as also high significance for the organization. Auditing these areas alone initially would help maximise the value of the auditing exercise. Hence, answer at Option A is the most appropriate one."

The most important part of the planning exercise would hence be the thorough understanding of each of the organization s businesses & its nuances.

Besides, more and more organizations are adopting Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy which further makes the portable device and the corporate network vulnerable. With users accessing the company s internal information systems from anywhere, a breach in physical security on one of these devices could undermine an organization s information security. Extreme care must be taken with this class. B is incorrect - Workstations: Usually located in more open or accessible areas of a facility. Because of their availability within the workplace, workstations can be prone to physical security problems if used carelessly. C is incorrect - Printers: Although the data is stored on electronic for the purpose. The reports, letters, communications etc. have to be printed. Organizations deploy printers. In order to optimize use of printer most organization deploy network based printers shared among group of users. D is incorrect Servers: Servers are the most physically secure class of systems. This is due to the common practice of placing them in a location that has better access and environmental control.

      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "C is correct - While these devices are considered highly secure, they suffer from the following disadvantages: Relatively high cost of acquisition, implementation and maintenance, hence they are used mainly to secure sensitive installations. Time consuming process of user registration. Privacy issues relating to use of devices like retina and fingerprint scanners. High error rates compared to other devices since they may result in a false rejection or more critically a false acceptance. A, B and D are incorrect Biometric locks are sophisticated and highly secure. Duplication of biometrics is not possible."

C is incorrect - Stealth viruses attempt to hide their presence from both the operating system and the antivirus software by encrypting themselves. They are similar to polymorphic viruses and are very hard to detect. D is incorrect These are Adware and Spyware that often come with some commercial software, both packaged as well as shareware software.

      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "B is correct - An alternative to one-time passwords is challenge response schemes. Instead of having the device just blindly generate a password, a user identifies himself to the server, usually by presenting his user ID. The server then responds with a challenge, which is usually a short phrase of letters and numbers. The user types the challenge into the device and, based on the challenge, the device responds with an output. The user then types that output in as his password to the server. This scheme is slightly more complicated, but it allows the password to be based on changing input rather than just time. A is incorrect - This is the most common authentication technique that depends on remembered information. The user, initially, identifies him using his login-id to the system and then provides the password information. Once the system is able to locate the match and is successful for both fields, the system authenticates the user and enables access to resources based on the authorization matrix. However if a match is not successful, the system returns a message (such as Invalid User or password ) thus preventing access to resources. C is incorrect - PIN is a type of password, usually a 4-digit numeric value that is used in certain systems to gain access, and authenticate. The PIN should be such that a person or a computer cannot guess it in sufficient time by using a guess and check method, i.e. where it guesses the PIN, and checks for correctness by testing it on the system that the person is attempting to gain access to and the process is repeated with a different guess till access is obtained. PINs are commonly used for gaining access to Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs). D is incorrect One-time passwords solve the problems of user-derived passwords. With one-time passwords, each time the user tries to log on he is given a new password. Even if an attacker intercepts the password, he will not be able to use it to gain access because it is good for only one session and predetermined limited time period. For example one time password for online card transaction is provided by bank to user on registered mobile is valid for 10 minutes only. One-time passwords typically use a small hardware device or software that generates a new password every time. The server also has the same software running, so when a user types in his password, the server can confirm whether it is the correct password. Each time the user logs on he has a new password, so it is much more secure."

      "explanation": "A is correct - Trojan: A malicious software, which the attacker can use to steal access control lists, passwords or other information. B is incorrect - In this crude form of attack, the attacker tries out every possible combination to hit on the successful match. The attacker may also use various password cracking software that assist in this effort. C is incorrect - Dictionary attack: On the similar lines as brute force, this type of attack is based on the assumption that users tend to use common words as passwords, which can be found in a dictionary, hence the name. The dictionary simply consists of a list of words, including proper names (Raju, Ramesh, Ibrahim, etc.) and also that of mythological or religious names (Krishna, Jesus, Osiris, Buddha, etc.). D is incorrect Spoofing attacks: In this technique, the attacker plants a Trojan program, which masquerades as the system s logon screen, gets the logon and password information and returns control to the genuine access control mechanism. Once the information is obtained, the attacker uses the information to gain access to the system resources."

A is incorrect - Anonymity: A network removes personal interaction i.e. most of the clues, such as appearance, voice, or context, by which we recognize acquaintances. B is incorrect Automation: In some networks, one or both endpoints, as well as all intermediate points, involved in a given communication may be machines with only minimal human supervision. D is incorrect - Opaqueness: Because the dimension of distance is hidden, users cannot tell whether a remote host is in the room next door or in a different country. In the same way, users cannot distinguish whether they are connected to a node in an office, school, home, or warehouse, or whether the node s computing system is large or small, modest or powerful.

These authentication details can be reused by an impersonator until they are changed. A is incorrect - Authentication foiled by guessing: Guess the identity and authentication details of the target, by using common passwords, the words in a dictionary, variations of the user name, default passwords, etc. B is incorrect - Authentication Foiled by Avoidance: A flawed operating system may be such that the buffer for typed characters in a password is of fixed size, counting all characters typed, including backspaces for correction. If a user types more characters than the buffer would hold, the overflow causes the operating system to by-pass password comparison and act as if a correct authentication has been supplied. Such flaws or weaknesses can be exploited by anyone seeking unauthorized access. C is incorrect Non-existent Authentication: Here the attacker circumvents or disables the authentication mechanism at the target computer. If two computers trusts each other s authentication an attacker may obtain access to one system through an authentication weakness (such as a guest password) and then transfer to another system that accepts the authenticity of a user who comes from a system on its trusted list.

Or the systems come with a demonstration or test account, with no required password. Some administrators fail to change the passwords or delete these accounts, creating vulnerability. A is incorrect - Session Hijacking: Session hijacking is intercepting and carrying on a session begun by another entity. In this case the attacker intercepts the session of one of the two entities that have entered into a session and carry it over in the name of that entity. For example, in an e-commerce transaction, just before a user places his order and gives his address, credit number etc. the session could be hijacked by an attacker. B is incorrect Man-in-the-Middle Attack: A man-in-the-middle attack is a similar to session hijacking, in which one entity intrudes between two others. The difference between man-in-the-middle and hijacking is that a man-in-the-middle usually participates from the start of the session, whereas a session hijacking occurs after a session has been established. The difference is largely semantic and not particularly significant. D is incorrect - Spoofing attacks: In this technique, the attacker plants a Trojan program, which masquerades as the system s logon screen, gets the logon and password information and returns control to the genuine access control mechanism. Once the information is obtained, the attacker uses the information to gain access to the system resources."

      "explanation": "A is correct - Traffic Analysis (or Traffic Flow Analysis): Sometimes not only is the message itself sensitive but the fact that a message exists is also sensitive. For example, if a wartime enemy sees a large amount of network traffic between headquarters and a particular unit, the enemy may be able to infer that significant action is being planned involving that unit. In a commercial setting, messages sent from the president of one company to the president of a competitor could lead to speculation about a takeover or conspiracy to fix prices. B is incorrect - Exposure: The content of a message may be exposed in temporary buffers, at switches, routers, gateways, and intermediate hosts throughout the network; and in the workspaces of processes that build, format, and present the message. A malicious attacker can use any of these exposures as part of a general or focused attack on message confidentiality. C and D are incorrect Mis-delivery: Message mis-delivery happens mainly due to congestion at network elements which causes buffers to overflow and packets dropped. Sometimes messages are mis-delivered because of some flaw in the network hardware or software. Most frequently, messages are lost entirely, which is an integrity or availability issue. Occasionally, however, a destination address will be modified or some router or protocol will malfunction, causing a message to be delivered to someone other than the intended recipient. All of these random events are quite uncommon. More frequent than network flaws are human errors, caused by mistyping an address."

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "B is correct - Ping of death: It is possible to crash, reboot or otherwise kill a large number of systems by sending a ping of a certain size from a remote machine. This is a serious problem, mainly because this can be reproduced very easily, and from a remote machine. Ping is an ICMP protocol which requests a destination to return a reply, intended to show that the destination system is reachable and functioning. Since ping requires the recipient to respond to the ping request, all the attacker needs to do is send a flood of pings to the intended victim. A is incorrect Connection Flooding: This is the oldest type of attack where an attacker sends more data than what a communication system can handle, thereby preventing the system from receiving any other legitimate data. Even if an occasional legitimate packet reaches the system, communication will be seriously degraded. C is incorrect - Traffic Redirection: A router is a device that forwards traffic on its way through intermediate networks between a source host s network and a destination s. So if an attacker can corrupt the routing, traffic can disappear. D is incorrect - DNS Attacks: DNS attacks are actually a class of attacks based on the concept of domain name server. A domain name server (DNS) is a table that converts domain names like www.icai.org into network addresses like 202.54.74.130, a process called resolving the domain name or name resolution. By corrupting a name server or causing it to cache spurious entries, an attacker can redirect the routing of any traffic, or ensure that packets intended for a particular host never reach their destination."

This allows the attacker to force the victim s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim. B is incorrect - Missing Function Level Access Control: Most web applications verify function level access rights before making that functionality visible in the UI. However, applications need to perform the same access control checks on the server when each function is accessed. If requests are not verified, attackers will be able to forge requests in order to access functionality without proper authorization. C is incorrect - Sensitive Data Exposure: Many web applications do not properly protect sensitive data, such as credit cards, tax IDs, and authentication credentials. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data deserves extra protection such as encryption at rest or in transit, as well as special precautions when exchanged with the browser.

During this phase, the team organizes the requirements in such a way that ascertains their clarity, consistency, and traceability etc. This phase is extremely important because often the document produced during specification is what the rest of the development stages will be based upon . A is incorrect Elicitation: The RE process is normally considered as the process of finding out what are the real needs of the customers as well as of the system . It also includes activities to explore how the software can meet the stakeholders goals and what alternatives might exist . B is incorrect - Analysis and Negotiation: This phase consists of a set of activities aimed to discover problems within the system requirements and achieve agreement on changes to satisfy all system stakeholders. If an analyst discovers some problems with the requirements during the analysis phase, such requirements are referred back to the elicitation phase. This process is related to the requirements that are incomplete, ambiguous and/or conflicting. Negotiation part is known as the process of discussing conflicts in requirements and finding some compromise which all of the stakeholders can live with . The principle of this process should be objective, where the judgments and the compromise for the system requirements should be based on technical and organisational needs. All the conflict requirements identified during the analysis process should be negotiated and discussed individually with the stakeholders in order to resolve the conflicts.

B and C are incorrect A commonly accepted approach to define project objectives is to start with a work breakdown structure (WBS) with each work module having its own objectives derived from main objectives. The WBS represents the project in terms of manageable and controllable units of work and forms the baseline for cost and resource planning. Detailed specifications regarding the WBS can be used to develop work packages (WP). Each WP must have a distinct owner and a list of main objectives, and may have a list of additional objectives. The WP specifications should include dependencies on other WPs and a definition of how to evaluate performance and goal achievement. A task list is a list of actions to be carried to complete each work package and includes assigned responsibilities and deadlines. The task list aids the individual project team members in operational planning and scheduling, that when merged together forms a project schedule. Project schedules are work documents containing the start and finish dates, percentage completed, task dependencies, and resource names of individuals planned to work on tasks. D is incorrect Qualitative Analysis of Risks is a part of project planning."

It is especially useful for resolving unclear objectives and requirements; developing and validating user requirements; experimenting with or comparing various design solutions, or investigating both performance and the human computer interface. Potential exists for exploiting knowledge gained in an early iteration as later iterations are developed. It helps to easily identify, confusing or difficult functions and missing functionality. It enables to generate specifications for a production application. It encourages innovation and flexible designs. It provides for quick implementation of an incomplete, but functional, application. It typically results in a better definition of these users needs and requirements than does the traditional systems development approach. A very short time period is normally required to develop and start experimenting with a prototype. This short time period allows system users to immediately evaluate proposed system changes. Since system users experiment with each version of the prototype through an interactive process, errors are hopefully detected and eliminated early in the developmental process. As a result, the information system ultimately implemented should be more reliable and less costly to develop than when the traditional systems development approach is employed.

An incomplete portion of a program code is put under a function (called stub) to allow the function. Here a stub is considered as black box and assumed to perform as expected, which is tested subsequently. Once the main module testing is complete, stubs are substituted with real modules one by one, and these modules are tested. This process continues till the atomic (smallest) modules are reached. Since decision-making processes are likely to occur in the higher levels of program hierarchy, the top-down strategy emphasizes on major control decision points encountered in the earlier stages of a process and detects any error in these processes.

This is done based on business operations. For example, converting one function (e.g. marketing) on new system, wait for the same be stabilized and then take another function (Finance/HR/production etc.) B is incorrect Cut-off or Direct Implementation / Abrupt Change-Over: This is achieved through an abrupt takeover an all or no approach. With this strategy, the changeover is done in one operation, completely replacing the old system in one go. Fig 6.1 depicts Direct Implementation, which usually takes place on a set date, often after a break in production or a holiday period so that time can be used to get the hardware and software for the new system installed without causing too much disruption. C is incorrect Pilot Changeover: With this strategy, the new system replaces the old one in one operational area or with smaller scale. Any errors can be rectified and new system is stabilized in pilot area, this stabilized system is replicated in operational areas throughout the whole system. For example converting banking operations to centralized systems are done at one branch and stabilized. The same process is replicated across all branches. D is incorrect Parallel Changeover: This is considered the most secure method, time and resource consuming implementation. The new systems is implemented, however the old system also continues to be operational. The output of new system is regularly compared with old system. If results matches over period of time and issues observed with new system are taken care of, the old system is discontinued."

The system of internal control in existence in the organisation with regard to: the flow of authorised, correct and complete data to the processing centre; the processing, analysis and reporting tasks undertaken in the installation . A, B and C are incorrect ISACA Standards ISACA ITAF, 1201 Engagement Planning , identifies risk assessment as one of the aspects and states that IS audit and assurance professionals, have to; Obtain an understanding of the activity being audited. The extent of the knowledge required should be determined by the nature of the enterprise, its environment, areas of risk, and the objectives of the engagement. Consider subject matter guidance or direction, as afforded through legislation, regulations, rules, directives and guidelines issued by government or industry. Perform a risk assessment to provide reasonable assurance that all material items will be adequately covered during the engagement. Audit strategies, materiality levels and resource requirements can then be developed. Develop the engagement project plan using appropriate project management methodologies to ensure that activities remain on track and within budget. ICAI Standards SA 200 Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the conduct of an audit in accordance with standards on Auditing , Issued by ICAI, requires an auditor to plan an audit and get following information: The auditor should plan his work to enable him to conduct an effective audit in an efficient and timely manner. Plans should be based on knowledge of the client s business. Plans should be made to cover, among other things: a. Acquiring knowledge of the client s accounting system, policies and internal control procedures; b. Establishing the expected degree of reliance to be placed on internal control; c. Determining and programming the nature, timing, and extent of the audit procedures to be performed; and d. Coordinating the work to be performed.

      "explanation": "A is correct - Most applications follow a standard procedure whereby, after taking in the user input they process it to generate the corresponding output. Snapshots are digital pictures of procedures of the console that are saved and stored in the memory. Procedures of the console refer to the application procedures that take input from the console i.e. from the Answer:board or the mouse. These procedures serve as references for subsequent output generations in the future. Typically, snapshots are implemented for tracing application software and mapping it. The user provides inputs through the console for processing the data. Snapshots are means through which each step of data processing (after the user gives the input through) is stored and recalled. B is incorrect - Integrated Test Facility (ITF) is a system in which a test pack is pushed through the production system affecting dummy entities. Hence this requires dummy entities to be created in the production software. For example, the auditor would introduce test transactions that affect targeting dummy customer accounts and dummy items created earlier for this testing purpose. C is incorrect Most computer operating systems provide the capability of producing a log of every event occurring in the system, both user and computer initiated. This information is usually written to a file and can be printed out periodically. As part of audit testing of general controls, it may be useful for the auditor to review the computer logs generated at various points to build an audit trail. Wherever possible, unauthorised or anomalous activity would need to be identified for further investigation. D is incorrect Embedded audit facilities consist of program audit procedures, which are inserted into the client s application programs and executed simultaneously. The technique helps review transactions as they are processed and select items according to audit criteria specified in the resident code, and automatically write details of these items to an output file for subsequent audit examination."

Marine, motor vehicle & business interruption insurance are not examples of E&O insurance since it does not fall within the limits of the definition given above .

      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Any good auditor would obviously be required to note & report deviations from the stated norms. They are also expected to compare the processes involved with that of competitors / other organizations. Lastly, the IS auditor would also have to check for compliance with laws and regulations. While all these could be goals of an audit of a BCP, they would not be the primary one. On the contrary, determining effectiveness of BCP & alignment with organizational goals are critical goals which would address most of the other aspects covered in Options B to D. Hence, answer in Option A alone is the most appropriate one."
